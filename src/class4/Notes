Operators: (+,-,*,/,%)
    Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operation like addition,subtractions ,
    we can compare things if two entiities are same or not if a number is greater than the other number or not.
    There are three main types of operators, They are Arithmetic operators, Relational operators and logical operators
Arithmetic operators:
    We use Arithmetic operators to perform simple math operators, Like additions, subtraction etc.
    + => Addition
    - => Subtract
    / => Division
    * => Multiplication
    % => Modulus ( to get/calculate remainder(4 islemden kalan)(the left from arithmetics math)



Relational operators.
    Relational operators are used to compare two qauantities. For example if something is bigger than other thing or
    if two numbers are same or not or if two boolean variables contain same values or not
    == => used to check if two variables contain the same value or not, if values are same, we get tru otherwise we get false.
    != => used to check if two variables dont contain the same value we get a true if they are not same,otherwise we get a false.
    >  => used to check if one value is greater than other value or not if greater we get a true, otherwise we get a false
    <  => used to check if one value is less than other value or not if less we get a true, otherwise we get a false
    >= => used to check if the values on the left greater than or equal the value on the right, we get a true, otherwise we get a false
    <= => used to check if the value on the left less than or equal the value on the right, we get a true, otherwise we get a false

Conditional Constructs
used to write conditional code. A piece of code that execute based on a condition if condition is true that java execute the code, otherwise it skips that code.
How to write IfELse condition.
    if(condition) {
     any line of code you can put  for ex:
     you can even put another if condition in the if bracket
       if(){
       }
     }
Important Note:
   1) for String we use equals method instead of == sign because it is a npn-primitive data type
   2) We can use (ctrl+alt+l(for windows)) or (cmd+pot+l(for Mac))
   3) if we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing part to check the other part.

if else conditions
   When we i have to test the same variables for multiple conditions i should us If else If
   When wei have multiple condintions and these conditions are dependent on each other Nested if conditions
